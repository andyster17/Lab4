# Why is it important to choose a License? 

 A license defines weather a piece of software is "free" or not. If a license limits your right to modify a program, then the program is not considered free. 
 If a license limits your right to redistribute, for example, if the license requires modified versions of a software to be non free, then the program is not considered free. Essentially, a license will define how your software can be modified, used, and distributed. Therefore depending on the intent of the creator, choosing the correct license is essential for the creator to maintain his or her vision of the software they have created. 
 
 # Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

When a piece of software isnt licensed, it is implied that the developer has the power to apply a license that would potentially cchange the legality of your use of the project. Because a license defines the legal limitations of usage and distribution of a software any software that is not explicitly license puts your project at the mercy of the developers licensing whims. 

# Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher. Do you agree with this claim?

Essentially they are saying that gopher failed due to a failure to distribute development efforts through open source, because they believed it would be better to define what was "right" regarding the software structure. It's pretty hard to argue against this claim, right and wrong are so subjective and at the end a democratically made decision on right is most likely a strong starting point for open source systems. By determining what is right, you are essentially alienating developers who do not agree with your decision. Open source is likely most effective when right and wrong are decided by the masses, inherently minimizing the amount of people who disagree with the direction. In the end I do agree that gopher most likey failed due to their decision to decide "right and wrong". 

# Justifying Linux's license choice. 

"Linux evolved in a completely different way. From nearly the beginning, it was rather casually hacked on by huge numbers of volunteers coordinating only through the Internet. " - Eric Raymond. It's clear that linux was designed by the people, for the people. To have a piece of software that evolved in such a democratic way, it only makes sense to use one of the purest forms of an open source license there is , a GPL v2 license. Even Linus Torvalds acknowledges the publics effects as linux went through multiple mutations to become what it is today. It is clear that the software communities contributions have made linux the famound OS we have today, and these contributions can really only be honored by giving Linux a GPL v2 license.
